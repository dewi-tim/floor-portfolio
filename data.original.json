      "title": "Altare di Primavera",
      "shortDescription": "Early spring wedding cake with almond olive oil, white chocolate pistachio ganache, and rhubarb jelly.",
      "fullDescription": "For Simone and Ewout\u2019s Tuscan-inspired wedding, I designed a custom almond olive oil cake to follow their five-course dinner at Toscanini.\n\nThe cake featured layers of white chocolate and roasted pistachio ganache; rich, smooth, and slightly salty to contrast the almond base. I poached fresh rhubarb in a syrup of blood orange juice and jasmine tea leaves, then used the infused syrup to create a translucent jelly top.\n\nThis added a jewel-like stained-glass effect that caught the natural light beautifully. The cake was finished with a sculptural floral arrangement, using the top as a vase-like base. The structured, glassy surface contrasted with the loose wildflower arrangement curated by Simone herself, bringing together texture, flavor, and aesthetic in one centerpiece.",

      "shortDescription": "Twisted honey bun made from croissant scraps, finished with smoked salt and a honey butter glaze.",
      "fullDescription": "I developed this bun by reworking scraps of laminated croissant dough. I separated the larger, bready pieces to form a new base dough, then used the more finely laminated scraps as a butter block, essentially recreating the lamination process from leftovers.\n\nThe result was an evenly layered dough made entirely from mixed scraps, which felt like a small magic trick, since their origin was from so many different doughs.\n\nThe filling is simple but refined: a sweet honey butter with crunchy smoked salt. I brushed the baked buns with a syrup made from the same ingredients to give them a glossy finish and a clean, balanced flavor.",

      "shortDescription": "Crunchy-chewy meringue with mascarpone cream and balsamic roasted grapes.",
      "fullDescription": "I made this pastry for Easter, using a slow-baked meringue as the base \u2014 light, crisp on the outside, soft and chewy inside. It acts like a little basket, holding slightly melted Easter eggs in the center.\n\nThe balsamic-thyme roasted grapes cut through the sweetness with a deep, tangy flavor, balancing everything out. Simple, airy, and just a bit unexpected.",

      "title": "Seasonal Focaccia",
      "shortDescription": "Focaccia with sweet potato, saffron cream, and samphire.",
      "fullDescription": "Each week, I create seasonal focaccia combinations using local meats and fresh, in-season vegetables. I pay close attention to texture, aiming for a focaccia that\u2019s light, moist, and rich with infused olive oil. Baking seasonal vegetables directly into the dough subtly flavors it and adds depth.\n\nI love pairing fresh cheeses like ricotta, gorgonzola, or stracciatella with something sharp or crunchy \u2014crispy nduja, samphire, or toasted nuts, for example. The possibilities are endless, especially when working with Kometen\u2019s beautifully fermented sourdough base.",

      "title": "The Third Line",
      "shortDescription": "Three-layered panna cotta jelly with toasted rice, chocolate ganache, and saffron grapefruit.",
      "fullDescription": "This cube-style pastry opens up endless creative possibilities and lately, I\u2019ve been drawn to the earthy, nutty depth of toasted brown rice. I infuse it into creams and ganaches, which adds a subtle roasted flavor and a delicate starchiness that gives the panna cotta an unexpectedly soft, silky texture.\n\nThe dark chocolate to cream ratio in the ganache is intentionally high, making it bold and intense, therefore it melts effortlessly on the tongue. A layer of grapefruit\u2013saffron jelly tops it all, bringing a fragrant, slightly sweet brightness that balances the richness and ties everything together into a light, addictive bite.",

      "fullDescription": "In a bakery producing over 4,000 croissants a week, dough scraps are inevitable. I began repurposing the laminated offcuts by layering and flattening them into a new dough, similar to puff pastry, characterised by the endless layers.\n\nThe result is an ultra-buttery bun, filled with dark chocolate and a sharp, fruity sea buckthorn compote that cuts through the richness beautifully.",

      "fullDescription": "A bold celebration of all my favorite flavors, intuitively decorated, bombastic and eclectic, my renaissance. A pistachio financier base with lemon-poached berries, layered with matcha\u2013pistachio ganache, from scratch mascarpone cream, and a blood orange curd.\n\nInspired by the playful mess of spaghetti bolognese and the delicacy of enoki mushrooms \u2014 a little surreal, a little camp, and just extravagant enough for a 21st birthday cake.",

      "fullDescription": "This cake, created for a collaboration between Kometen Brood Caf\u00e9 and Bon Iver, explored exactly the tension between disgust and delicacy. Inspired by the anatomy of a salmon, I sculpted the body from seven olive oil vanilla loaf cakes, each filled with a bright, sweet berry compote (nothing fishy involved).\n\nEvery detail was hand-carved and piped, from fins to open belly, with edible glitter used to mimic the real fish scales. The result was unsettling, yet impressive.",
